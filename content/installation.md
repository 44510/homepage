To use Lomorage, you need to run the Lomorage service in your local network, either on Windows, OSX or Raspberry Pi. And then you need to download the client APP at the APP store. Once you run the Lomorage service, the client APP is supposed to find the service running automatically with zero configuration, then you can upload photos on the Phone.

## 2. Install Lomorage Service

The first step is to set up the Lomorage service.

**You can choose which version of Lomorage Service to download based on your preference**. Running Lomorage service on Windows or OSX gives you better performance compared with on Raspberry Pi, the uploading and accessing the backup will be faster, but running Windows or OSX is not energy efficient as using Raspberry Pi.
